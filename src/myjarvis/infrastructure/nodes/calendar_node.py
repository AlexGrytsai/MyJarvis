Google Calendar. It enables the AI agent to manage events, check schedules,
and answer questions related to dates and appointments.

class CalendarNode(BaseNode):
    """
    A node for interacting with a calendar service.

    This node should be implemented to connect to a user's calendar (e.g., via
    Google Calendar API). It will require handling OAuth 2.0 for user
    authorization. The agent can use this to create, modify, or retrieve
    calendar events.

    Implementation Details:
    - Use the Google Calendar API client library.
    - Implement an OAuth 2.0 flow to get user consent and store credentials
      securely for each user.
    - The `execute_command` method will need to map commands to specific API calls.

    Example commands to implement:
    - 'create_event': Takes 'summary', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'attendees'
      as parameters.
    - 'get_events_for_date': Takes a 'date' and returns a list of events.
    - 'find_free_time': Takes 'start_date', 'end_date', 'duration' to
      find available slots.
