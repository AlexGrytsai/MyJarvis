"""
This module contains the implementation for the GoogleDocsNode.

The GoogleDocsNode allows an AI agent to interact with Google Docs, enabling
it to create new documents, read existing ones, and append or modify content.
This is useful for tasks like report generation, note-taking, and content
creation.

class GoogleDocsNode(BaseNode):
    """
    A node for interacting with the Google Docs API.

    This node should be implemented to provide a seamless connection to Google
    Docs. It will require handling the Google Docs API and managing user
    authentication and authorization, likely through OAuth 2.0.

    Implementation Details:
    - Use the Google Docs API client library for Python.
    - Implement an OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain the necessary permissions from the
      user to access their documents.
    - Store user credentials securely.
    - Map high-level commands to specific Google Docs API calls.

    Example commands to implement:
    - 'create_document': Takes a 'title' parameter and creates a new blank
      document.
    - 'read_document': Takes a 'document_id' and returns its content as
      plain text.
    - 'append_text': Takes 'document_id' and 'text' to add content to the end
      of a document.
    - 'search_documents': Takes a 'query' and returns a list of matching
      documents from the user's Google Drive.
