This module contains the implementation for the EmailNode.

The EmailNode provides functionality for the AI agent to interact with an
email service (e.g., Gmail, Outlook). It can be used to send emails, check for
new messages, read email content, and summarize threads.

class EmailNode(BaseNode):
    """
    A node for interacting with an email service.

    This node should be implemented to connect to a user's email account.
    Similar to the CalendarNode, this will likely require an OAuth 2.0 flow
    to get user permission to access their mailbox.

    Implementation Details:
    - Use the Gmail API or a generic IMAP/SMTP library.
    - Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure user authorization.
    - Handle different email formats (plain text, HTML) and attachments.

    Example commands to implement:
    - 'send_email': Takes 'to', 'subject', 'body' as parameters.
    - 'check_new_emails': Returns a list of unread emails with sender and
      subject.
    - 'read_email': Takes an 'email_id' and returns the full content of the
      email.
    - 'search_emails': Takes a 'query' (e.g., from:person@example.com) and
      returns matching emails.
