"""
This module contains the implementation for the SearchNode.

The SearchNode is responsible for interacting with a search engine or service
(e.g., Google Search, DuckDuckGo, Tavily API) to perform web searches and
retrieve information. It allows the AI agent to find real-time information
from the internet.

class SearchNode(BaseNode):
    """
    A node for performing web searches.

    This node should be implemented to connect to a search service provider.
    The LLM will use this node to answer questions about recent events or to
    find information not present in its training data.

    Implementation Details:
    - Choose a search provider (e.g., Tavily, SerpAPI, Google Custom Search).
    - Use an API client or library to interact with the chosen service.
    - Securely manage API keys using environment variables or a configuration
      service.

    Example commands to implement:
    - 'search_web': Takes a 'query' parameter and returns a list of search
      results, including snippets and URLs.
    - 'get_page_content': Takes a 'url' parameter and returns the text content
      of the web page.
