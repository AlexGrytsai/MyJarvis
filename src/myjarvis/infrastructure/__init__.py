"""This package contains modules that implement the application's infrastructure,
handling external concerns like databases, third-party APIs, caching, and more.

The infrastructure layer is responsible for the technical implementation of the
interfaces (repositories, services) defined in the domain layer. It isolates the
core application logic from the specific technologies and tools used.
