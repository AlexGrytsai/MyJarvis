"""Database session management.

This module is responsible for setting up and managing the database connection and session lifecycle.
It provides a centralized way to get a database session for use in other parts of the application,
particularly within repository implementations.

Implementation Details:
- It should use SQLAlchemy's `create_async_engine` for creating an asynchronous engine.
- An `async_sessionmaker` should be configured to create new `AsyncSession` objects.
- A dependency injectable function (e.g., `get_db_session`) should be created to provide
  a session to the application's request handlers or command handlers. This function will
  yield a session and ensure it is closed properly after the request is handled,
  managing the transaction scope (commit on success, rollback on failure).
- Database connection settings should be loaded from a configuration object (e.g., Pydantic's BaseSettings)
  to avoid hardcoding credentials.
